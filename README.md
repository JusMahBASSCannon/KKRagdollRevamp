### Originally by RagdollAnon | Continued by JusMahBASSCannon

**KKRagdollRevamp** enables ragdoll physics for all characters loaded in CharaStudio at the push of a button. With click and drag functionality, support with the animation plugin _Timeline_, and more features on the way, KKRagdollRevamp is your future home to turn Koikatsu into your very own physics sandbox. 

# Features

## Placeable Collisions
Ragdolls are currently set up to only respond to **Collision Items** contained in the zipmod you download with this plugin. This allows you to create completely custom scenes and ragdoll maps! Additionally, collisions also work when they are hidden from the Workspace - meaning you can make *any* Koikatsu map - item maps or maps loaded from the Maps menu - compatible with KKRagdollRevamp. On top of that, because collisions are essentially items that your placing in the scene, they are saved in the scene data - this means saves that have collision items can be shared with others who have the mod, opening the door for a community effort of Ragdoll-compatible maps for everyone to enjoy!



## Click and Drag
![KKRR_ClickDrag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca945a1d-e853-437b-916d-8fe1251b0265)

Channel your inner GMod player and fling your waifus around! Or use the advanced controls by scrolling the mouse wheel to move the ragdoll closer and farther away from the camera, with more controls coming soon.

## Timeline Support
![KKRR_Timeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3dbccbc-defe-4534-8ce1-b0e707f727ac)

Take advantage of KKRagdollRevamp with the ability to include it in your own animations! Whether it's making collision items move and rotate for the ragdolls to react to, or by toggling the ragdoll through keyframes, KKRagdollRevamp natively supports Timeline.

## And many more!
